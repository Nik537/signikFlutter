2. Click "Register & Connect"
3. Wait for successful connection to broker

### **2. Discovering Devices**
1. Use "Refresh All" to update device lists
2. Filter available devices by type using the dropdown
3. View all registered devices in the left panel

### **3. Connecting to Devices**
1. Select an available device from the right panel
2. Click "Connect" to send a connection request
3. Wait for the other device to accept/reject
4. Connected devices appear in "My Connections"

### **4. Managing Connections**

4. Monitor document status through the system

## Configuration

### **Broker URL**
Default: `http://localhost:8000`

To change the broker URL, modify the `SignikBrokerService` constructor in `MainForm.cs`:

```csharp
_brokerService = new SignikBrokerService("http://your-broker-url:port");
```

### **Refresh Intervals**
- **Device Data**: 5 seconds
- **Heartbeat**: 10 seconds

Modify in `MainForm.cs` constructor:

```csharp
_refreshTimer.Interval = 5000; // 5 seconds
_heartbeatTimer.Interval = 10000; // 10 seconds
```

## Architecture

### **Components**
- **MainForm.cs**: Primary UI and orchestration
- **Models/Device.cs**: Device and connection data models
- **Services/SignikBrokerService.cs**: Broker communication service

### **Communication Flow**
1. **HTTP REST API**: Device registration, connection management
2. **WebSocket**: Real-time messaging and notifications
3. **Heartbeat System**: Device online status monitoring

### **Data Models**
- **Device**: ID, Name, Type, IP, Online Status
- **DeviceConnection**: Connection relationships and status
- **SignikMessage**: WebSocket message format

## Troubleshooting

### **Connection Issues**
- Ensure Signik Broker is running on the specified URL
- Check firewall settings for HTTP/WebSocket connections
- Verify network connectivity between devices

### **Registration Failures**
- Confirm broker is accessible at the configured URL
- Check if device name conflicts exist
- Verify IP address detection is working

### **WebSocket Problems**
- Restart the application if WebSocket connection fails
- Check broker logs for connection errors
- Ensure WebSocket ports are not blocked

## API Integration

The application integrates with these Signik Broker endpoints:

- `POST /register_device` - Device registration
- `GET /devices` - All devices
- `GET /devices/online` - Online devices only
- `POST /devices/{id}/connect` - Initiate connection
- `GET /devices/{id}/connections` - Device connections
- `PUT /connections/{id}` - Update connection status
- `POST /heartbeat/{id}` - Send heartbeat
- `WebSocket /ws/{id}` - Real-time messaging

## Development

### **Adding Features**
1. Extend models in `Models/` directory
2. Add service methods in `SignikBrokerService`
3. Update UI in `MainForm.cs`
4. Handle new WebSocket message types

### **Custom Styling**
Modify colors, fonts, and layouts in the `InitializeComponent()` method.

### **Error Handling**
All network operations include try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages.
